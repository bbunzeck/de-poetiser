# de-poetiser

A jupyter notebook that de-poetises texts by replacing words with random synonyms from WordNet.

The current implementation is fairly naive and works with simple string replacement, without paying attention to parts-of-speech or punctuation.

Current text sample: first chapter of [The Great Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby).
