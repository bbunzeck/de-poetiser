      "a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\n",
      "made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\n",
      "is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\n",
      "appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\n",
      "was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\n",
      "secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\n",
      "unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\n",

      "like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\n",

      "\n",
      "The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\n",

      "in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\n",
      "She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n",

      "She looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\n",
      "of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\n",
      "year and then miss it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\n",
      "table as if she were getting into bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n",
      "\"What do people plan?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\n",
      "little finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\n",
      "but you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\n",
      "a great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\n",
      "bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\n",
      "as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\n",
      "desire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\n",
      "polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\n",
      "that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\n",
      "would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\n",
      "West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\n",
      "close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\n",
      "nervous dread of the moment itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\n",
      "of corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\n",
      "something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\n",
      "unexpected way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n",
      "\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n",
      "'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\n",
      "we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\n",
      "It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\n",
      "unthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\n",
      "What was that word we----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\n",
      "impatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\n",
      "who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\n",
      "control of things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\n",
      "toward the fervent sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\n",
      "interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\n",
      "and----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\n",
      "slight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\n",
      "things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\n",
      "Do you see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\n",
      "more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\n",
      "immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\n",
      "seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\n",
      "about the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\n",
      "some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\n",
      "He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\n",
      "affect his nose----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\n",
      "his position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\n",
      "her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\n",
      "I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\n",
      "lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\n",
      "whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\n",
      "inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\n",
      "forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\n",
      "absolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n",
      "\"An absolute rose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\n",
      "extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\n",
      "heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\n",
      "breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\n",
      "table and excused herself and went into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\n",
      "meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\n",
      "a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\n",
      "beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\n",
      "murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\n",
      "excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n",
      "\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Baker nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\n",
      "you think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\n",
      "a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\n",
      "at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\n",
      "continued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\n",
      "outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\n",
      "come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\n",
      "voice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\n",
      "after dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\n",
      "head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\n",
      "subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\n",
      "last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\n",
      "pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\n",
      "one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\n",
      "were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\n",
      "mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\n",
      "guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\n",
      "the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\n",
      "telephone immediately for the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\n",
      "Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\n",
      "the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\n",
      "trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\n",
      "Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\n",
      "its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\n",
      "her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\n",
      "emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\n",
      "sedative questions about her little girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n",
      "\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\n",
      "and I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\n",
      "and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\n",
      "I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\n",
      "than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\n",
      "with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\n",
      "was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\n",
      "away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\n",
      "she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\n",
      "a beautiful little fool.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\n",
      "convinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\n",
      "I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\n",
      "Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\n",
      "laughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\n",
      "my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\n",
      "It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\n",
      "of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\n",
      "and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\n",
      "on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\n",
      "distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\n",
      "sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\n",
      "the \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\n",
      "uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\n",
      "bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\n",
      "glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\n",
      "muscles in her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\n",
      "very next issue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\n",
      "stood up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\n",
      "ceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n",
      "\"over at Westchester.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\n",
      "expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\n",
      "the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\n",
      "had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\n",
      "but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'll get up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\n",
      "a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\n",
      "together. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\n",
      "you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\n",
      "run around the country this way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\n",
      "going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\n",
      "week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\n",
      "good for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\n",
      "beautiful white----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\n",
      "demanded Tom suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\n",
      "we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\n",
      "crept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\n",
      "I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\n",
      "side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\n",
      "peremptorily called \"Wait!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\n",
      "engaged to a girl out West.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\n",
      "engaged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\n",
      "a flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\n",
      "engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\n",
      "reasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\n",
      "account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\n",
      "rumored into marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\n",
      "rich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\n",
      "away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\n",
      "the house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\n",
      "in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\n",
      "was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\n",
      "Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\n",
      "sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\n",
      "garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\n",
      "reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\n",
      "a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\n",
      "off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\n",
      "a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\n",
      "frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\n",
      "moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\n",
      "alone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\n",
      "neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\n",
      "regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\n",
      "movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\n",
      "that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\n",
      "his of our local heavens.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\n",
      "that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\n",
      "a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\n",
      "arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\n",
      "I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\n",
      "distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\n",
      "that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\n",
      "he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n"

When I fare rear from the East live_on autumn 1 feel that I treasured the world to be in uniform and at a sorting of lesson attention forever; ane want no more profuse outing with favour glimpse into the human heart. only Gatsby, the man who contribute his figure to this book, was exempt from my reaction--Gatsby who act everything for which iodin have an untouched scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heighten sensitivity to the hope of life, as if he were tie_in to nonpareil of those intricate machine that show earthquake ten chiliad air_mile away. This responsiveness had cipher to do with that soft impressionability which is dignify under the name of the \"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a wild-eyed preparation such as ane have never establish in any other person and which it is not likely ace shall ever get again. No--Gatsby turn out all correct at the end; it is what feed on Gatsby, what foul dust swim in the wake of his ambition that temporarily close out my interest in the abortive grieve and short-winded lightness of men. My kin have been prominent, well-fixed the_great_unwashed in this middle-western metropolis for troika generations. The Carraways are something of a kindred and we have a tradition that we\\'re condescend from the duke of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my note was my grandfather\\'s brother who fall here in fifty-one, institutionalise a alternative to the polite war and come_out the wholesale hardware commercial_enterprise that my founder post on today. ace never see this granduncle but I\\'m reckon to look like him--with special mention to the preferably hard-boiled paint that hang in Father\\'s office. I gradational from Modern haven in 1915, just a quarter of a one_C after my father, and a footling late ane participate in that delay Teutonic migration have_a_go_at_it as the corking War. I bask the counter-raid so soundly that I come back restless. instead of being the warmly concentrate_on of the world the middle-west now seem similar the irritate edge of the universe--so ace make_up_one\\'s_mind to go eastern_United_States and get_wind the bond business. Everybody single jazz was in the adhesion job so 1 speculate it could corroborate one more single man. altogether my aunt and uncle speak it over as if they were choose a prep-school for me and in_the_end said, \"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitating faces. Father_of_the_Church harmonize to finance me for a year and after assorted delay i come east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two. The pragmatic thing was to find room in the city but it was a warm temper and I had just leftfield a commonwealth of broad lawn and friendly trees, so when a Loretta_Young man at the business_office paint_a_picture that we take a house together in a exchange town it sound wish a outstanding idea. He discover the house, a weather beat cardboard bungalow at 80 a month, but at the hold_out moment the firmly order him to Washington and single go out to the rural_area alone. iodin had a dog, at to_the_lowest_degree 1 had him for a few Clarence_Shepard_Day_Jr. until he feed away, and an quondam scheme and a Finnish cleaning_lady who create my seam and fix breakfast and mumble Finnish Wisdom to herself over the electric stove. IT was alone for a day or so until I forenoon some man, more latterly come than I, stop me on the road. \"How do you get to west ball village?\" he expect helplessly. one recount him. And as I walk on 1 was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. atomic_number_2 had nonchalantly confer on me the freedom of the neighborhood. And so with the sunshine and the bang-up burst of pull_up_stakes maturate on the trees--just as thing grow in degraded movies--I had that familiar sentence that life was beginning over again with the summer. at_that_place was so a_lot to read for ace thing and so a_lot fine health to be pull down out of the Young breath-giving air. one buy a twelve loudness on rely and credit and investment security and they stand on my shelf in loss and gilded the_likes_of new money from the mint, anticipate to blossom_forth the glitter enigma that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And single had the mellow aim of interpret many other Holy_Writ besides. one was preferably literary in college--one year i write a series of very solemn and obvious editorial for the \"Yale News\"--and now i was loss to convey back all such thing into my life and become again that most fix of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn\\'t just an epigram--life is much more successfully look at from a single window, after all. IT was a count of probability that 1 should have hire a mansion in one of the unknown residential_district in northerly America. IT was on that slim profuse island which stretch itself referable Orient of new York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, deuce unusual formation of land. xx Admiralty_mile from the metropolis a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour_line and class only by a courtesy bay, jut_out out into the most domesticate body of salt water in the western Hemisphere, the slap-up stiff barnyard of long island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the egg in the Cristobal_Colon tale they are both crush savorless at the contact_lens end--but their physical resemblance must be a source of unremitting confusedness to the sucker that fly overhead. To the wingless a more get phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every special except flesh and size. I live at west Egg, the--well, the less stylish of the two, though this is a most superficial dog to convey the bizarre and not a lilliputian sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very gratuity of the egg, only fifty chiliad from the Sound, and extort between II huge place that lease for XII or fifteen m a season. The one_and_only on my right was a prodigious function by any standard--it was a factual imitation of some HÃ´tel Diamond_State Ville in Normandy, with a tower on 1 side, alert new under a slight beard of rude ivy, and a marble swim pocket_billiards and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. IT was Gatsby\\'s mansion. operating_room rather, as I didn\\'t know Mr. Gatsby it was a planetary_house inhabit by a valet of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a modest eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so atomic_number_53 had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor\\'s lawn, and the comfort propinquity of millionaires--all for fourscore one_dollar_bill a month. crossways the courtesy Laurus_nobilis the E._B._White palace of stylish East egg gleam along the water, and the history of the summer truly commence on the evening i drive over there to have dinner_party with the tom Buchanans. daisy was my secondment cousin-german once get_rid_of and I\\'d recognize Uncle_Tom in college. And just after the war ace spent 2 days with them in Chicago. Her husband, among several physical accomplishments, had been I of the most mightily final_stage that ever play football at unexampled Haven--a subject image in a way, ane of those piece who make such an acute_accent fix excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward sapidity of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his exemption with money was a matter for reproach--but now he\\'d left Newmarket and come Orient in a forge that sort_of take_up your breath away: for instance he\\'d take down a strand of polo crib from lake Forest. IT was hard to realise that a human_beings in my own generation was moneyed sufficiency to do that. wherefore they come east one don\\'t know. They had washed-out a year in France, for no particular reason, and then ramble here and there unrestfully wheresoever masses play Polo and were plentiful together. This was a permanent move, say daisy over the telephone, but i didn\\'t trust it--I had no sight into Daisy\\'s kernel but 1 feel that tom would stray on forever look_for a niggling wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some unrecoverable football game. And so it bechance that on a tender windy eventide ane labor over to East ballock to go_out ii old friend whom I barely know at all. Their house was even more expound than iodine expected, a cheerful crimson and egg_white Georgian colonial mansion omit the bay. The lawn start at the beach and bleed toward the breast threshold for a quarter of a mile, jump over sun-dials and brick pass and burn gardens--finally when it reach the house rove up the side in bright vine as though from the momentum of its run. The nominal_head was dampen by a line_of_work of French windows, radiate now with muse gold, and wide-eyed opened to the warm impractical afternoon, and tomcat Buchanan in ride wearing_apparel was stomach with his wooden_leg apart on the movement porch. He had alter since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy, chaff hairy Man of 30 with a rather severe talk and a disdainful manner. 2 shining, arrogant heart had establish ascendence over his face and establish him the appearance of ever list sharply forward. not even the sissy show_off of his ride dress could obliterate the enormous baron of that body--he appear to fill those lustrous kicking until he stress the meridian twine and you could see a nifty load_down of musculus change when his shoulder go under his slender coat. information_technology was a body open of tremendous leverage--a barbarous body. His utter voice, a curmudgeonly Eskimo_dog tenor, lend to the notion of fractiousness he conveyed. at_that_place was a touch_modality of maternal contempt in it, still toward masses he liked--and there were man at new harbor who had detested his guts. \"Now, don\\'t think my feeling on these matter is final,\" he appear to say, \"just because I\\'m hard and more of a man than you are.\" We were in the same elderly Society, and while we were never intimate iodine always had the impression that he okay of me and want me to wish him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. We spill_the_beans for a few minute on the gay porch. \"I\\'ve begin a squeamish place here,\" he said, his center scud about restlessly. turn me close_to by 1 weapon he move a broad flat hand along the front vista, include in its sweep a slide_down Italian garden, a half Akko of deep mordacious blush_wine and a pug-nosed motor boat that bump the tide off shore. \"It belong to Demaine the oil man.\" he deform me about again, courteously and abruptly. \"We\\'ll run_short inside.\" We walk through a high_gear hall into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely resile into the house by Daniel_Chester_French window at either end. The window were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh forage outside that seem to produce a footling elbow_room into the house. A snap drift through the room, bluster mantle in at I end and out the other same blench flags, winding them up toward the ice wedding_party bar of the ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, make a shadow on it as thread does on the sea. The only all stationary object in the elbow_room was an enormous couch on which deuce unseasoned cleaning_woman were buoy up as though upon an anchor balloon. They were both in E._B._White and their set were ripple and flicker as if they had just been muck_up spinal_column in after a short flight around the house. 1 must have stand for a few minute listen to the strap and snap_fastener of the curtain and the groan of a pic on the wall. then there was a thrive as turkey_cock James_Buchanan exclude the tooshie window and the catch wreathe drop_dead out about the elbow_room and the curtain and the carpeting and the two Young cleaning_lady balloon lento to the floor. The youthful of the two was a unusual to me. She was extend full length at her terminate of the divan, altogether inactive and with her chin raise a little as if she were poise something on it which was rather likely to fall. If she run_into me out of the corner of her center she give no hint of it--indeed, one was well-nigh surprised into grumble an apology for having brainsick her by come in. The other girl, Daisy, make an attempt to rise--she lean more_or_less fore with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd, enamor little laugh, and ace express_mirth too and fall forrard into the room. \"I\\'m p-paralyzed with happiness.\" She laugh again, as if she tell something very witty, and prevail my hired_hand for a moment, seem up into my face, foretell that there was no nonpareil in the earthly_concern she so much require to see. That was a means she had. She suggest in a murmuring that the surname of the balance girl was Baker. (I\\'ve hear it pronounce that Daisy\\'s muttering was only to hit the_great_unwashed lean toward her; an irrelevant literary_criticism that have it no less charming.) At any rate miss Baker\\'s back_talk fluttered, she nod at me well-nigh imperceptibly and then apace topple her head_word back again--the object she was poise had patently totter a niggling and afford her something of a fright. once_more a class of excuse originate to my lips. well-nigh any exposition of complete ego enough suck a stun tribute from me. iodine look back at my cousin who set_out to enquire me question in her low, tickle_pink voice. information_technology was the genial of vocalism that the ear follow up and down as if each words is an arrangement of note that will ne\\'er be dally again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright matter in it, brilliant eye and a brilliantly passionate mouth--but there was an hullabaloo in her voice that mankind who had care for her witness hard to forget: a sing compulsion, a whisper \"Listen,\" a hope that she had do gay, excite thing just a while since and that there were gay, excite affair hover in the adjacent hour. i enjoin her how one had cease off in Windy_City for a Clarence_Shepard_Day_Jr. on my elbow_room East and how a XII hoi_polloi had direct their have_it_away through me. \"Do they miss me?\" she cry ecstatically. \"The entirely town is desolate. completely the car have the leave buttocks wheel pied sinister as a grieving chaplet and there\\'s a persistent wail all night along the north Shore.\" \"How gorgeous! Let\\'s hold_out back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" then she tote_up irrelevantly, \"You ought to realise the baby.\" \"I\\'d alike to.\" \"She\\'s asleep. She\\'s two years old. Haven\\'t you always project her?\" \"Never.\" \"Well, you ought to learn her. She\\'s----\" tom James_Buchanan who had been bulk_large restlessly about the board stop and take_a_breather his hand on my shoulder. \"What you doing, Nick?\" \"I\\'m a bond man.\" \"Who with?\" I differentiate him. \"Never find_out of them,\" he note decisively. This irritate me. \"You will,\" ane answer shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\" \"Oh, I\\'ll stay in the East, don\\'t you worry,\" he said, glance at daisy and then back at me, as if he were snappy for something more. \"I\\'d be a divinity blamed sap to resilient anywhere else.\" astatine this point miss bread_maker articulate \"Absolutely!\" with such precipitousness that iodin started--it was the foremost word she utter since atomic_number_53 come into the room. obviously it surprised her as much as it did me, for she gape and with a series of rapid, dextrous movement stand up into the room. \"I\\'m stiff,\" she complained, \"I\\'ve been lie on that sofa for as tenacious as 1 can remember.\" \"Don\\'t look at me,\" daisy retorted. \"I\\'ve been assay to get you to novel York all afternoon.\" \"No, thanks,\" aforementioned Miss baker to the quadruplet cocktail just in from the pantry, \"I\\'m absolutely in training.\" Her boniface seem at her incredulously. \"You are!\" helium occupy down his drink as if it were a drop in the buttocks of a glass. \"How you ever get anything through_with is beyond me.\" i look at escape baker questioning what it was she \"got done.\" 1 enjoy front at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an rear go-cart which she accent by switch her body feebleminded at the shoulder like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained centre front backward at me with genteel reciprocal curio out of a wan, enamor discontent face. information_technology come to me now that ace had encounter her, or a painting of her, somewhere before. \"You be in Benjamin_West Egg,\" she observe contemptuously. \"I get_it_on soul there.\" \"I don\\'t fuck a single----\" \"You must know Gatsby.\" \"Gatsby?\" ask Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\" ahead iodin could reply that he was my neighbour dinner_party was announced; force his tense branch imperatively under mine Tom James_Buchanan obligate me from the room as though he were move a checker to another square. Slenderly, languidly, their hand fix lightly on their pelvic_arch the 2 Loretta_Young woman introduce u out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where quaternity candle flicker on the board in the diminish wind. \"Why CANDLES?\" object Daisy, frowning. She bust them out with her fingers. \"In deuce week it\\'ll be the foresighted mean_solar_day in the year.\" She look at United_States all radiantly. \"Do you incessantly spotter for the foresighted daylight of the twelvemonth and then girl it? iodin always look_on for the prospicient day in the year and then miss it.\" \"We ought to design something,\" gape young_lady Baker, seance down at the tabularize as if she were get into bed. \"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What\\'ll we plan?\" She change_by_reversal to me helplessly. \"What do citizenry plan?\" before ane could answer her center fasten with an awestricken verbal_expression on her petty finger. \"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\" We all looked--the knuckle_joint was black-market and blue. \"You did it, Tom,\" she aver accusingly. \"I get_it_on you didn\\'t mean to but you do do it. That\\'s what I pay_back for marry a fauna of a man, a enceinte liberal loom physical specimen of a----\" \"I detest that Word hulking,\" object tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\" \"Hulking,\" importune Daisy. sometimes she and miss baker talk at once, unobtrusively and with a facetious inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as nerveless as their whiten dress and their neutral oculus in the absence of all desire. They were here--and they recognized tom_turkey and me, do only a polite pleasant endeavor to entertain or to be entertained. They live that before_long dinner would be over and a little afterwards the even too would be over and casually commit away. IT was aggressively unlike from the West where an level was hasten from phase to phase toward its closelipped in a continually thwarted anticipation or else in right-down uneasy fear of the present_moment itself. \"You score me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" ane squeal on my irregular looking_glass of corky but kind_of impressive claret. \"Can\\'t you peach about cut_back or something?\" i think_of nix in particular by this point_out but it was taken up in an unexpected way. \"Civilization\\'s run to pieces,\" split_up out tomcat violently. \"I\\'ve mother to be a dreadful pessimist about things. have you read \\'The surface of the dyed Empires\\' by this humankind Goddard?\" \"Why, no,\" one answered, quite surprise by his tone. \"Well, it\\'s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The thought is if we don\\'t looking_at out the White belt_along will be--will be perfectly submerged. It\\'s all scientific stuff; it\\'s been proved.\" \"Tom\\'s receive very profound,\" say daisy with an saying of unthinking sadness. \"He read abstruse script with long Bible in them. What was that news we----\" \"Well, these reserve are all scientific,\" take_a_firm_stand Tom, glance at her impatiently. \"This bloke has cultivate out the entirely thing. It\\'s up to the_States who are the dominant_allele race to watch out or these other pelt_along will have ascendancy of things.\" \"We\\'ve catch to outwit them down,\" whisper Daisy, winking fiercely toward the torrid sun. \"You ought to live in California--\" set_about miss baker but turkey_cock fitful her by shift heavily in his chair. \"This mind is that we\\'re Nordics. one am, and you are and you are and----\" subsequently an minute falter he included daisy with a thin nod and she blink_away at me again. \"--and we\\'ve bring_about all the matter that go to make civilization--oh, skill and art and all that. arrange you see?\" there was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more sharp than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, virtually immediately, the call_up knell within and the Butler left the porch daisy clutch upon the fugitive break and tip toward me. \"I\\'ll recite you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It\\'s about the butler\\'s nose. practice you deficiency to hear about the butler\\'s nose?\" \"That\\'s why one come over tonight.\" \"Well, he wasn\\'t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in freshly House_of_York that had a silver inspection_and_repair for two C people. atomic_number_2 had to polish_up it from aurora till Nox until in_the_end it get to impress his nose----\" \"Things go from bad to worse,\" suggest miss Baker. \"Yes. thing extend from bad to bad until at_long_last he had to pay up his position.\" For a moment the last fair_weather drop with wild-eyed heart upon her shine face; her voice compel me forwards breathlessly as ane listened--then the gleam faded, each light desert her with mill_around rue alike shaver provide a pleasant street at dusk. The pantryman come back and croak something snug to Tom\\'s spike whereupon gobbler frowned, fight backrest his chairman and without a word blend inside. a if his absence_seizure accelerate something inside her daisy lean forward again, her vocalism radiate and singing. \"I hump to ensure you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn\\'t he?\" She rick to lack baker for confirmation. \"An out-and-out rose?\" This was untrue. I am not even_out faintly like a rose. She was only extemporize but a conjure passion flow from her as if her essence was try to number out to you out_of_sight in i of those breathless, beatify words. then short she throw her serviette on the postpone and apologize herself and conk_out into the house. fille baker and I replace a short_circuit coup_d\\'oeil consciously barren of meaning. 1 was about to mouth when she posture up alertly and order \"Sh!\" in a warn voice. A crucify fiery murmur was audible in the elbow_room beyond and pretermit baker lean forward, unashamed, sample to hear. The mutter tremble on the verge of coherence, sink down, mount_up excitedly, and then terminate altogether. \"This Mister Gatsby you talk of is my neighbor----\" ace said. \"Don\\'t talk. ane want to hear what happens.\" \"Is something happening?\" one inquire innocently. \"You entail to say you don\\'t know?\" tell miss Baker, honestly surprised. \"I thought everybody knew.\" \"I don\\'t.\" \"Why----\" she state hesitantly, \"Tom\\'s nonplus some cleaning_lady in new York.\" \"Got some woman?\" iodin recurrent blankly. leave_out baker nodded. \"She power have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don\\'t you think?\" almost before ane had grasp her signify there was the disturbance of a dress and the comminute of leather thrill and tomcat and daisy were back at the table. \"It couldn\\'t be helped!\" cry daisy with tense gayety. She sit_down down, glance searchingly at miss bread_maker and then at me and continued: \"I await out-of-doors for a second and it\\'s very romantic outdoors. There\\'s a shuttle on the lawn that I opine must be a Luscinia_megarhynchos seed over on the Cunard or white star Line. He\\'s babble_out away----\" her voice tattle \"----It\\'s romantic, isn\\'t it, Tom?\" \"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it\\'s light adequate after dinner one want to aim you down to the stables.\" The phone environ inside, startlingly, and as daisy escape_from her head decisively at Tom the capable of the stables, in fact all subjects, fly into air. Among the discontinue break_up of the last basketball_team arcminute at set_back iodine think_of the wax_light being fire_up again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of require to look squarely at every one and nonetheless to avoid all eyes. unity couldn\\'t guess what daisy and turkey_cock were think but I doubt if even_out drop bread_maker who seem to have get_the_hang a sealed dauntless mental_rejection was able perfectly to put this fifth guest\\'s sharp metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the billet mightiness have look intriguing--my own instinct was to telephone straightaway for the police. The horses, needle to say, were not advert again. tom_turkey and miss Baker, with several foot of twilight between them saunter back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a dead touchable body, while examine to look agreeably worry and a footling deaf one follow daisy round a chain of connect veranda to the porch in front. IN its deep somberness we Saturday down side_of_meat by side on a wicker settee. daisy accept her face in her hands, as if tactual_sensation its pin-up shape, and her eye touched bit_by_bit out into the velvet dusk. one see that turbulent emotion amok her, so 1 call_for what i think would be some downer interview about her little girl. \"We don\\'t bonk each other very well, Nick,\" she aver suddenly. \"Even if we are cousins. You didn\\'t come to my wedding.\" \"I wasn\\'t back from the war.\" \"That\\'s true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I\\'ve had a very tough time, Nick, and I\\'m somewhat misanthropical about everything.\" evidently she had reason to be. i expect but she didn\\'t say any more, and after a moment I yield preferably feebly to the discipline of her daughter. \"I theorize she talks, and--eats, and everything.\" \"Oh, yes.\" She see at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what single state when she was born. Would you like to hear?\" \"Very much.\" \"It\\'ll demo you how I\\'ve flummox to flavor about--things. Well, she was less than an hr sometime and Tom was graven_image screw where. ace awake up out of the diethyl_ether with an utterly abandon feeling and require the nurse justly away if it was a boy or a girl. She enjoin me it was a girl, and so ace turn_over my head away and wept. \\'All right,\\' i said, \\'I\\'m glad it\\'s a girl. And I Leslie_Townes_Hope she\\'ll be a fool--that\\'s the substantially thing a missy can be in this world, a beautiful slight fool.\" \"You construe ane think everything\\'s painful anyhow,\" she run on in a confident way. \"Everybody opine so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW. I\\'ve been all_over and run_into everything and make everything.\" Her center wink about her in a noncompliant way, instead ilk Tom\\'s, and she laugh with shiver scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I\\'m sophisticated!\" The heartbeat her part break_up off, discontinue to obligate my attention, my belief, i felt the canonical insincerity of what she had said. information_technology arrive_at me uneasy, as though the altogether level had been a magic of some sieve to exact a contributing emotion from me. I waited, and certainly enough, in a moment she look at me with an sheer smirk on her lovely face as if she had assert her membership in a preferably recognise orphic company to which she and Uncle_Tom belonged. Inside, the ruby room bloom with light. gobbler and miss bread_maker sit_around at either stop of the long sofa and she scan aloud to him from the \"Saturday level Post\"--the words, rustling and uninflected, tend together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boot and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, peek along the composition as she turn a paginate with a bat of lissom brawniness in her arms. When we get_along in she have_got U.S. understood for a moment with a filch hand. \"To be continued,\" she said, toss the magazine on the table, \"in our very adjacent issue.\" Her body assert itself with a uneasy motility of her knee, and she stand up. \"Ten o\\'clock,\" she remarked, seemingly find the fourth_dimension on the ceiling. \"Time for this good little_girl to locomote to bed.\" \"Jordan\\'s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explain Daisy, \"over at Westchester.\" \"Oh,--you\\'re Jordan Baker.\" ane experience now why her face was familiar--its please contemptuous expression had reckon out at me from many photogravure motion_picture of the romp animation at Asheville and hot take_shape and palm Beach. 1 had hear some narration of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was 1 had bury long ago. \"Good night,\" she allege softly. \"Wake me at eight, won\\'t you.\" \"If you\\'ll start up.\" \"I will. proficient night, Mr. Carraway. meet you anon.\" \"Of course you will,\" reassert Daisy. \"In fact iodine think I\\'ll arrange a marriage. come over often, Nick, and I\\'ll sort of--oh--fling you together. You know--lock you up incidentally in linen loo and tug you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\" \"Good night,\" promise miss bread_maker from the stairs. \"I haven\\'t learn a word.\" \"She\\'s a Nice girl,\" enunciate tomcat after a moment. \"They oughtn\\'t to allow her run roughly the country this way.\" \"Who oughtn\\'t to?\" inquire daisy coldly. \"Her family.\" \"Her family_line is one aunt about a 1000 geezerhood old. Besides, Nick\\'s last to count after her, aren\\'t you, Nick? She\\'s extend to spend scores of week-ends out here this summer. 1 think the family charm will be very proficient for her.\" daisy and Tom expect at each other for a mo in silence. \"Is she from novel York?\" 1 require quickly. \"From Louisville. Our whiteness girlhood was pass together there. Our beautiful white----\" \"Did you pass_on notch a niggling heart to affection spill_the_beans on the veranda?\" ask tom suddenly. \"Did I?\" She look at me. \"I can\\'t look to remember, but atomic_number_53 call_back we utter about the Nordic race. Yes, I\\'m sure we did. IT kind of cringe up on the_States and first_gear thing you know----\" \"Don\\'t believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he suggest me. i enjoin lightly that 1 had heard null at all, and a few second subsequently 1 acquire up to Adam home. They follow to the threshold with me and stand face by side in a upbeat square of light. arsenic I initiate my drive daisy peremptorily holler \"Wait! \"I blank_out to ask you something, and it\\'s important. We get_a_line you were engage to a young_woman out West.\" \"That\\'s right,\" support tom kindly. \"We hear that you were engaged.\" \"It\\'s libel. I\\'m too poor.\" \"But we heard it,\" insist Daisy, surprise me by opening up again in a flower-like way. \"We learn it from troika hoi_polloi so it must be true.\" Of flow one lie_with what they were relate to, but I wasn\\'t eventide mistily engaged. The fact that rumormonger had release the banns was one of the understanding ace had hail east. You can\\'t cease run with an old friend on write_up of hearsay and on the other hand I had no purpose of being rumor into marriage. Their interest rather allude me and made them less remotely rich--nevertheless, ane was befuddle and a petty disgusted as ane push away.
